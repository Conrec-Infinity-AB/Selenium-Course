## Browser window ##
> driver.maximize_window()
> driver.minimize_window()
> driver.fullscreen_window()

Get the window dimension
> size = driver.get_window_size()
> width = driver.get_window_size().get("width")
> height = driver.get_window_size().get("height")

Set the browser window size. Note it does not change the screen resolution
> driver.set_window_size(1024, 768)

get window dimensions
> position = driver.get_window_position()
> xPos = driver.get_window_position().get('x')
> yPos = driver.get_window_position().get('y')

Move the window to a specific position on the primary monitor
> driver.set_window_position(x, y)

Returns and base64 encoded string into image
> driver.save_screenshot('./image.png')


## Alerts ##
Many times developers builds their own alerts by using popup windows/modals, then these alert commands does not work. Instead we have to handle the popup as a web page and find the buttons and field to interact with.

driver.execute_Script("alert('An anoying alert with Close button')")
driver.execute_Script("confirm('An anoying alert with Cancel & OK buttons')")
driver.execute_Script("prompt('An inputbox with Cancel & OK buttons','Pre-filled text')")

alert = driver.switch_to.alert
alert.accept()
alert.dismiss()

alert.text - Get the text from the alert, will it also get the text from the input field?
alert.sendKeys(â€œ")

## IFrames ##
Page Navigation
*   Frames (inline frame) load other HTML elements inside a web page.
*   Kind of like "HTML within HTML"
*   Elements inside an iFrame can't be selected directly with Selenium.
*   Instead, you have to switch from the "main"HTML into the Frame.
*   Same problem in reverse - main HTML ngt accessible within iFrame

Steps:
*   Find iFrame element
*   Switch to Frame - driver.switch_to.frame(iframe_element)
*   Find element of interest within iFrame
*   Switch back to main HTML - driver.switch_to.default_content()

driver.get('https://www.firsturl.com/')
driver.find_element(By.ID, 'inside-element') # Fails!
iframe_element = driver.find_element(...)
driver.switch_to.frame(iframe_element)
driver.find_element(By.ID, 'inside-element') # Works driver.switch_to.default_content()

Switch iframe by id
> driver.switch_to.frame('buttonframe')

Switching to iframe based on index
> iframe = driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME,'iframe')[1]
> driver.switch_to.frame(iframe)

## Windows and tabs ##
Get window handle
WebDriver does not make the distinction between windows and tabs. If your site opens a new tab or window, Selenium will let you work with it using a window handle. Each window has a unique identifier which remains persistent in a single session. You can get the window handle of the current window by using:
> handle = driver.current_window_handle

Opens a new tab and switches to new tab
> driver.switch_to.new_window('tab')

Opens a new window and switches to new window
> driver.switch_to.new_window('window')

Close the tab or window
> driver.close()

Switch back to the old tab or window.
Always switch back to original tab or window or webdriver will try to execute commands on the closed tab/window
> driver.switch_to.window(handle)

### Difference between driver.close() and driver.quit() ###

We have used driver.close() in most examples and its fine when were only running Selenium tests in a single tab or browser window. But there is also driver.quit(). SO whats the difference between them?

> driver.close() 
Will only close the current window or tab in the WebDriver session used by the browser process.

>driver.quit()
Goes further and closes all windows and tabs associated with the WebDriver session. It will also close the browser process and background driver process. 

If remote webdriver is used with a Selenium Grid, then the Grid is notified that the browser is no longer in use so it can be used by another session.

So make sure to end Selenium tests correctly by using driver.quit() so webdriver background processes and ports are not running in background and blocks new connections.
