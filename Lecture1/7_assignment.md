# Assignment 1 #
## What we learned ##
This first lecture we learned about how to set up a new Selenium project with Visual Studio Code and Python. We also talked about different CSS selectors and got an insight in what we can do with Google dev tools. 

## Assignment ##
In this first assignment we will implement some Selenium code for the locators we learned about. Test them all if possible. All information is available in the documentation in this repository.

So:

1. Create a new Python project in Visual Studio Code
2. Make sure you set up an virtual environment so you do not install packages globally
3. Try to install packages by hand using pip install (If it fails copy the requirements.txt and use that one)
4. When everything is setup then select an page online where you can use as a test page. The page should not have to complicated html/Javascript code so its easy for you to find elements by using Google Dev tools
5. Write some code to find different elements on the page using all the locators we learned about today
6. Play around with Google Dev tools to see how you can use it in different ways

Thats it!
