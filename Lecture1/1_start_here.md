# Lecture 1 #

## Intro ## 
In this first lecture we will discuss some theory about test automation. It includes what a HTML page consists of, like the DOM-tree, CSS selectors and the dev tools we can use to help us to find elements in a HTML page. 

We will also learn how to setup and create some simple Python code where we use Selenium WebDriver to open a web page and query different elements.
