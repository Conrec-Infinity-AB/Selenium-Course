### DOM Tree ###

*_Definition from Wikipedia_*

A Document Object Model (DOM) tree is a hierarchical representation of an HTML or XML document. It consists of a root node, which is the document itself, and a series of child nodes that represent the elements, attributes, and text content of the document. Each node in the tree has a parent node, except for the root node, and can have multiple child nodes.

Elements in an HTML or XML document are represented as nodes in the DOM tree. Each element node has a tag name, attributes, and can contain other element nodes or text nodes as children. For example, an HTML document with the following structure:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Webpage</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>This is my simple webpage.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
