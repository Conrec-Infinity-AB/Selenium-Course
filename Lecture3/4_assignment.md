As a user I want to login to my member page and check my messages and when I have checked my messages i should og out again

1.  As a user i want to write a test which opens the page "https://conrec-infinity-ab.github.io/Selenium-Course/"
    I want to have a successful login to the page with my username: letmein@gmail.com and password: secretpassword. 
    PASS the test if its a successful login 
    
2. When I have logged in i want to verify that the members section on the main page (index.html) is visible. If so PASS the test
   
3.  When I have made sure I am logged in i also want to see if i have any new messages. 
    If there are no new messages then PASS the test

4.  To make sure no one hacks my account, i want to log out again.

Use either Behave (BDD) or Robot Framework to create the test and make sure assetions are used in the tests

Create a report of the test 

Create a new projects and import relevant libraries/packages for BDD / Robot framework and assert library used.
